## Interactive Music Visualizer

This repository includes a minimal WebGL-based music visualizer. It captures audio from your microphone and displays a 3D cube that pulses with the sound.

### Running

1. Serve the repository with a local web server (for example `npx serve .`).
2. Open `index.html` in a modern browser.
3. Click **Start Visualizer** and allow microphone access.
