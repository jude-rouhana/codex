## Interactive Music Visualizer

This repository includes a simple WebGL-based music visualizer. It can visualize microphone input or a provided `.wav` file using different shapes such as a cube, sphere, particles or bars.

### Running

1. Serve the repository with a local web server (for example `npx serve .`).
2. Open `index.html` in a modern browser.
3. Choose a visualization type from the dropdown and select **Microphone** or **WAV File** as the audio source. If using a file, pick a `.wav` file from your computer.
4. Click **Start Visualizer** and allow microphone access if required.
